## Introduction

The desire to understand our roots is a fundamental human instinct. **LEG** (Lineage Exploration and Genealogy) is born from this desire, aiming to make the process of discovering and documenting family history more accessible, engaging, and collaborative. This project serves as a central hub for anyone interested in genealogy, offering a curated collection of resources, fostering a supportive community, and potentially developing open-source tools to aid in genealogical research.

We believe that everyone has a story to tell, and understanding our family's past enriches our present and shapes our future. LEG is here to help you uncover those stories.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the LEG project are:

* **Centralize Resources:** To create a comprehensive collection of links, guides, and information relevant to genealogical research.
* **Foster Community:** To build a supportive and collaborative environment for genealogists of all skill levels to connect, share knowledge, and assist each other.
* **Promote Best Practices:** To advocate for accurate research methodologies, ethical data handling, and proper citation of sources in genealogical work.
* **Explore Technological Solutions:** To investigate and potentially develop open-source tools and utilities that can streamline and enhance the genealogical research process (this is a future aspiration).
* **Democratize Genealogy:** To make genealogical research more accessible to individuals regardless of their background or resources.
