# Lumen Migration: Future Scope

## Purpose
This document outlines which parts of the current Laravel codebase can be migrated to Lumen for improved scalability and performance. This migration is marked as **future scope** and is not part of the current development cycle.

---

## Why Lumen?
Lumen is a micro-framework by Laravel, optimized for stateless APIs, microservices, and high-throughput workloads. Migrating suitable components to Lumen can:
- Reduce application overhead
- Improve response times for APIs
- Enable independent scaling of microservices

---

## Candidates for Migration

| Laravel Directory/File                | Move to Lumen? | Notes                                      |
|---------------------------------------|:--------------:|---------------------------------------------|
| `app/Http/Controllers/Api/`           |      Yes       | Stateless API endpoints                     |
| `app/Services/`                       |      Yes*      | If stateless, not tightly Laravel-coupled   |
| `app/Models/`                         |      Yes*      | If not using advanced Laravel features      |
| `app/Jobs/`                           |      Yes*      | For queue workers/microservices             |
| `routes/api.php`                      |      Yes       | API routes                                 |
| `app/Http/Middleware/`                |      Yes*      | API-specific only                          |
| `resources/views/`                    |      No        | Blade not supported in Lumen                |
| `app/Livewire/`                       |      No        | Not supported in Lumen                      |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/`          |      No*       | Only if simple, stateless auth              |

*Yes*: Only if the code is stateless and not dependent on advanced Laravel features (e.g., Blade, session, advanced authentication, Livewire, etc.)

---

## Migration Steps (For Future Reference)
1. **Extract API Controllers and Routes**
2. **Copy Models and Services** (stateless only)
3. **Migrate Middleware** (API-specific only)
4. **Setup Lumen Config and Environment**
5. **Test and Benchmark**

---

## Out of Scope
- Blade views, Livewire components, and web UI logic
- Features requiring advanced Laravel service providers or packages not supported by Lumen

---

## Status
**This migration is marked as future scope. No immediate action required.**
