# Implementation

## Development Approach

- **Modular, Component-Driven Architecture:**
  - Follows Laravel's MVC structure, with clear separation of controllers, services, models, and views.
  - Livewire components are used for dynamic, reactive UI elements (e.g., forms, modals, relationship management).
  - Service classes encapsulate business logic (e.g., Neo4jIndividualService for graph operations).
- **D3.js for Data Visualizations:**
  - All interactive family trees and timelines are rendered using D3.js, leveraging update/enter/exit patterns and scalable SVG layouts.
  - Visualizations are modular and reusable, following the Reusable API pattern.
- **Neo4j for Relationship Data:**
  - All family relationships (parent-child, spouse, sibling, ancestry, etc.) are stored and queried in Neo4j.
  - Eloquent model events ensure data consistency between PostgreSQL and Neo4j.
- **Tailwind CSS for UI Styling:**
  - Utility-first CSS ensures a consistent, responsive, and modern design across all views and components.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Strict adherence to PSR-12, SOLID principles, and Laravel conventions.
  - Code is organized for maintainability, scalability, and testability.

## Coding Standards

- **PHP 8.4+ with Strict Typing:**
  - All PHP files declare strict types and use modern language features.
- **PSR-12 Code Style:**
  - Enforced via linters and code reviews.
- **Descriptive Naming:**
  - Variables, methods, and classes use clear, intention-revealing names.
- **Repository Pattern:**
  - Data access is abstracted via repositories and service classes where appropriate.
- **Form Requests for Validation:**
  - All user input is validated using Laravel's Form Request classes or inline validation.
- **Eloquent ORM:**
  - Used for all structured data, with relationships, scopes, and accessors.
- **Exception Handling & Logging:**
  - Centralized via Laravel's exception handler and logging facilities.
  - Custom exceptions and error messages for domain-specific errors.

## Framework & Library Usage

- **Livewire:**
  - Powers dynamic forms, relationship management, and real-time UI updates without custom JavaScript.
  - Used for optimistic UI and stateful components.
- **D3.js:**
  - Handles all SVG-based visualizations, including family trees and timelines.
  - Implements update/enter/exit patterns for efficient DOM updates.
  - Scalable layouts and semantic encodings for accessibility.
- **Neo4j:**
  - All relationship queries and traversals are written in Cypher and executed via the Laudis Neo4j PHP client.
  - Advanced queries (ancestors, descendants, shortest path) are exposed via dedicated controller endpoints.
- **Tailwind CSS:**
  - Used throughout for layout, spacing, color, and responsive design.
  - Custom configuration for dark mode and design tokens.
- **Alpine.js:**
  - Used for lightweight interactivity (e.g., sidebar toggles, dark mode switch).

## UI/UX Implementation

- **Minimalist, Modern Interface:**
  - Consistent use of Tailwind and Blade layouts for a clean, accessible UI.
- **Tree View Controls:**
  - Interactive controls for zoom, pan, layout switching, and exporting, as described in TREE_VIEW.md.
- **Progressive Disclosure:**
  - Advanced options and features are hidden by default and revealed as needed.
- **Accessibility & Mobile-First:**
  - All components are designed to be accessible and responsive, with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation where appropriate.

## Database Design

- **Core Entities:**
  - Individuals, Groups, and Trees are modeled as Eloquent models in PostgreSQL.
- **Graph Relationships:**
  - All family relationships are stored in Neo4j, with Cypher queries for traversals and advanced queries.
- **Data Consistency:**
  - Eloquent model events ensure that changes in Individuals are reflected in Neo4j.
- **GEDCOM Support:**
  - Import/export of GEDCOM files is supported for interoperability with other genealogy tools.
  - **Note:** Handling of sources and notes in GEDCOM import/export is planned for a future release. The parser structure supports these records, but import/export logic does not yet process or link them.

## Testing & Quality

- **PHPUnit:**
  - Used for backend unit and feature tests, covering controllers, services, and model logic.
- **Dusk:**
  - Used for browser-based and end-to-end UI/feature tests.
- **Accessibility Checks:**
  - Manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.
- **CI/CD Ready:**
  - Codebase is structured for integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
